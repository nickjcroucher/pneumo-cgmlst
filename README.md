# pneumo-cgmlst

Core genome COGs for S. pneumoniae.  Version 1.0.0 of the scheme is from Corander et al 2017 Nat. Ecol. Evol. 1:1950-60.  Future versions may include additional alleles.

The scheme has been formatted similar to Ridom so that releases should be compatible with existing software.

## Usage

Each `.fasta` file represents a gene (e.g. `CLS00147.fasta` contains known alleles of `CLS00147`).  Each allele is numbered sequentially.
